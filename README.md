# Student Race/Ethnicity Predictor 

This Flask-based machine learning application predicts a student's race/ethnicity group (Group Aâ€“E) using their math, reading, and writing scores. The model was trained using Random Forest with class weighting and SMOTE to correct for class imbalance. The application includes a simple Bootstrap frontend and is ready for deployment on Heroku with GitHub Actions CI/CD.
